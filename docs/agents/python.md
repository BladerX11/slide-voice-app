# Python Style

Use Google-style docstrings. For exceptions, only include those which the function explicitly raises, or is indicated as raised in the docstring of functions within. Check the docstring of the function within before including its exceptions. None Returns do not need to be included.

Do not create functions or methods for a single statement.
