# Python Style

Create docstrings. For exceptions, only include those which the function explicitly raises, or is indicated as raised in the docstring of functions within. Check the docstring of the function within before including its exceptions. None Returns do not need to be included.

Assume in pptx files, ancestor tags of the target may be missing, but required siblings are there.

Place functions after those they rely on and closely related ones, only used in one other function, close together.
